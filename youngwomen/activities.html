            <h2>Going on a picnic</h2>
            <p>One of the activities we do is going on a picnic. We often go to Maria Reiche park, which is in Costa Verde.</p>

            <h2>Spa</h2>
            <p>We learn to take care of our facial skin using masks made by ourselves; using oat, coffee, etc. If time allows it, we learn to use make-up and paint out nails, thus developing our femininity. This activity can take place in the church chapel, or at a leader's or a young lady's place.</p>

            <h2>Karaoke</h2>
            <p>I believe this is clear. Karaoke is always fun, girls love it. It can help ladies to get to know each other better. This activity can take place in the church chapel, or at a leader's or a young lady's place.</p>

            <h2>Making desserts</h2>
            <p>Sometimes we learn how to make desserts that are easy to make, since most of us are newbies. This activity can take place in the church chapel, or at a leader's or a young lady's place.</p>

            <h2>Playing sports</h2>
            <p>We mostly play volleyball; however, if there’s any other sport the girls would want to try, fine by us! This activity usually happens on Saturday, but it can be any other day the girls choose. It mostly takes place at the church chapel.</p>

            <h2>Visiting other young women</h2>
            <p>Visiting our friends is important because that way we encourage sisterhood, which must be always present in the organization (and everywhere). This activity is usually dedicated to the less active ones, but we can always visit any other girl. We divide by groups leaded by a leader or an older young woman; it’s done this way to be able to visit as many young women as possible.</p>
