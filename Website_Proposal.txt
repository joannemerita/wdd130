I believe it would nice to create a page for the Young Women. We make gatherings monthly to see wich activities we will do throughout the month. Since we only have a WhatsApp group, it's difficult for less active Young Women to catch up. The home page would be about what we are, what we do, what do we believe in, etc. The child pages would be about our activities for the month, and all the Young Women and a little presentation. That's my idea. :)
