"What did you learn from the websites on careers in web design and development, and what did you learn from this class in general?"
Most of the careers I read about had something to do with organizing or leading something. I learned that there's more than just languages and programming. Groups need to work well, there's control of the budget, there's an estimation of when the project will be done, maintenance of the page, and many other things that require more than just using languages. At the moment, I'm not interested in any of those, and I'm still not sure what job to choose. For now, I want to keep studying and not stop, I don't want to stop learning and studying. I don't understand the second question very much, but I'll try to. In general, I learned that I can use all my capabilities to grow in my job and that there's more than studies or a diploma. It's good to have nice social skills, and assertive communication between co-workers so the project can succeed. Every project has a path to follow, or a goal to achieve, and the employees' job is to make it happen. That's all I've learned, but since I need more words I'll share something I've been thinking about.
My parents say I can be good at being a UX designer, and that I should focus on that since it best fits my talents. I know that I wouldn't be bad at it, but I would like to go more into the back-end field. I've only tried one programming language though (Python). Despite this, if I end up choosing the web developer part, I might choose to be a back-end developer. (262 words)
