        <h2>Emerita</h2>
        <p>Grettings, everyone. I'm not really known as "Emerita", but 
        I really like it, so you can call me either by that or my real name. 
        I'm from Lima, Peru. It is very polluted here, lol but it is okay
        (well it's not, but you get me).</p>
        <p>I chose the Applied Technology degree. Even though it's not my 
            dream to study this, it is my goal. My hobbies are playing video 
            games, listening to music, drawing, watching anime, and much more. 
            I'm 18 yo and I don't have a family yet, but I plan to have one in 
            the future.</p>
        <p>I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ since I was baptized 
            10 years ago. I don't have a call in the Church right now, but my 
            bishop told me he would give one to me. I'm excited to know what 
            will it be.</p>
        <p>By the way, the little dog next to me is Luther, a member of my family.</p>
